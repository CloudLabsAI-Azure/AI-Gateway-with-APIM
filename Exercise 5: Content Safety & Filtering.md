# Exercise 5: Content Safety & Filtering 

### Estimated Duration: 30 Minutes

## Lab Overview

In this exercise, you will implement content safety and moderation controls within the Azure AI Gateway to ensure that all user inputs and AI-generated outputs adhere to organizational safety standards. You will explore Microsoft Foundry’s Guardrails and Controls, including text, image, multimodal moderation, groundedness detection, prompt shields, and protected material detection. You will then specify real-time content filtering rules using request headers and test how these filters affect API responses. Finally, you will apply content safety enforcement policies through Azure API Management (APIM), deploy the required infrastructure using Bicep templates, configure gateway-level safety rules, and validate how unsafe requests are blocked before reaching the underlying model. By the end, you will gain hands-on experience applying safety controls across multiple layers model, request, and gateway, to ensure secure and compliant AI interactions.

### Introduction

**Azure AI Content Safety** helps detect and prevent harmful user-generated and AI-generated content in applications and services. Its features ensure that text, images, and other media align with your organization’s content safety guidelines.

* **Azure AI Content Safety** offers a suite of tools for monitoring and moderating content in real time:

  * **Text moderation:** Detects and filters harmful or unsafe language in text, including hate speech, violence, or explicit content.
  * **Image moderation:** Analyzes images to identify and block visual content that may be inappropriate or offensive.
  * **Multimodal content analysis:** Evaluates combined content types (such as text and images) to provide a more complete view of potential risks.
  * **Groundedness detection:** Ensures that AI-generated text is factually accurate and supported by trusted source materials.
  * **Prompt shields:** Detects and mitigates prompt injection or document-based attacks that attempt to manipulate large language models (LLMs).
  * **Protected material detection:** Identifies and blocks outputs that may contain copyrighted or third-party protected text, such as song lyrics, recipes, or articles.

These AI-powered features help organizations detect risks, prevent the spread of harmful or misleading content, and maintain a safe, trustworthy, and inclusive environment for their users.

## Summary

In this exercise, you learned how Azure AI Content Safety protects both user inputs and AI-generated outputs by enforcing safety policies across multiple layers of an AI system. You explored Microsoft Foundry’s moderation capabilities for text, images, and multimodal content, along with groundedness detection, prompt shields, and protected material identification. You then created a custom content filter and applied it to a deployed GPT-4o-mini model, followed by testing safe and unsafe prompts using a Python script to observe how harmful requests are either blocked with a structured content filtering error or result in a safe refusal response from the model. Finally, you enabled policy enforcement through Azure API Management to validate that unsafe prompts are intercepted before reaching the underlying AI model. Through this hands-on experience, you gained practical knowledge of implementing responsible AI controls, reducing risk, aligning with compliance standards, and ensuring safe behavior for real-world AI applications.
