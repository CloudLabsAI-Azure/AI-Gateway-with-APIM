# Exercise 3: Exposing MCP Tools via API Management 

### Estimated Duration: 60 Minutes

## Lab Overview

In this exercise, you will learn how to expose Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools and servers through Azure API Management (APIM) to securely integrate AI agents with backend services. MCP allows large language models (LLMs) to interact with external tools and data sources in a structured, governed way. Through this lab, you will explore how to configure API Management as a central gateway for MCP-based communication, enabling features such as rate limiting, OAuth-based authentication, and secure token handling. You’ll also learn how to publish REST APIs as MCP tools, connect AI agents to MCP endpoints, and test end-to-end authorization flows with Microsoft Entra ID. By the end of this exercise, you will understand how to expose, secure, and manage MCP servers and REST APIs using Azure’s enterprise-grade management and security capabilities.

## Lab Objectives

In this exercise, you will be performing the following tasks:

- Task 1: Expose existing MCP Servers in API Management

- Task 2: Publish REST APIs as MCP tools in API Management

- Task 3: Implement client authorization and secure access for MCP servers


## Task 1: Expose existing MCP Servers in API Management

## Task 2: Publish REST APIs as MCP tools in API Management

In this task, you will deploy and test the Model Context Protocol (MCP) using Azure API Management (APIM). You will initialize environment variables, deploy the required infrastructure using Bicep, and verify MCP server connectivity using Python SDK commands.

1. In Visual Studio Code, expand the **lab (1)** folder, then select **mcp-from-api (2)**, and click **mcp-from-api.ipynb (3)** to open the notebook.

    ![](./media/e3t2p1.png)

1. Once the notebook opens, review all the sections and their descriptions. The notebook is divided into initialization, deployment, and verification steps that guide you through the process of configuring an MCP-enabled API gateway.

1. Scroll down to **Initialize notebook variables** and enter the following details:

   - resource_group_name: **Q2a-APIM-RG-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**

   - aiservices_config: **foundry4-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**

   - apim_name: **apim-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**

        >**Note:** Ensure that the correct name is entered in the respective section.

1. **Run** the cell **Initialize notebook variables** to set up environment variables. This step defines your resource names, Azure region, and other configuration details required for consistent and automated deployment across subscriptions.

    ![](./media/initvar-e3t2.png)

1. Next, scroll down to **Create deployment using 🦾 Bicep** and **Run** the cell to deploy all required Azure resources. The Bicep template provisions services like Azure API Management, Azure OpenAI, and related components needed for the MCP setup. Wait for the deployment process to complete successfully. The cell output will show status messages confirming that the resource group, API Management instance, and supporting components were created.

    ![](./media/deploy-e3t2.png)

1. Next, scroll to **Get the deployment outputs** and **Run** the cell to retrieve key configuration details such as the Log Analytics Workspace ID, APIM URL, and MCP endpoint. These outputs will be used later to connect and test your MCP-enabled service.

    ![](./media/outputs-e3t2.png)

1. Next, scroll to the **Test the connection to the MCP servers and List Tools** section and **Run** the cell to test your MCP setup. This command initiates a connection to the deployed MCP servers, validates network communication, and retrieves a list of available tools that your MCP service exposes. If the connection test is successful, the output will display the list of MCP tools, confirming that the API Management instance has been successfully transformed into an MCP-compatible service endpoint.

    ![](./media/test-e3t2.png)

1. Next, scroll down to **Execute an Azure AI Foundry Agent using MCP Tools** and **Run** the cell to demonstrate how an Azure AI Agent can use MCP tools published via API Management. This step sets up an asynchronous connection between Azure OpenAI, MCPServerStreamableHttp, and the deployed MCP endpoints, allowing the AI Agent to invoke tools exposed through APIM. You can observe the agent interacting with MCP tools, retrieving data, or performing operations through the configured MCP service.

    ![](./media/execute-e3t2.png)

    ![](./media/execute-e3t2(1).png)

    >**Note:** If you run into an error, open the **mcp-from-api (1)** folder, right-click the generated **params.json (2)** file and click on **Delete (3)**. Then click on **Restart (4)** and rerun the notebook from the beginning.

     ![](./media/error-resolve-e3t2.png)

1. Next, scroll down to **Test the rate limit on Microsoft Learn MCP pass-through** and **Run** the cell to verify that rate-limiting policies applied in API Management are functioning correctly. This test sends multiple requests through the APIM-managed MCP endpoint to ensure that requests exceeding the defined threshold are properly throttled. You’ll notice that after a certain number of requests, the API Management service returns a `429` "Too Many Requests response", confirming that the rate-limit policy is working as expected.

    ![](./media/rate-e3t2.png)

1. Next, scroll down to **Test the Product Catalog MCP Authorization WITHOUT a valid token** and **Run** the cell. This test attempts to call the Product Catalog MCP endpoint without authorization headers, simulating an unauthenticated client request. You should observe a 401 Unauthorized response, verifying that the security policy in policy.xml correctly blocks requests lacking valid tokens.

    ![](./media/notoken-e3t2.png)

1. Next, scroll down to **Test the Product Catalog MCP Authorization WITH a valid token** and **Run** the cell. This test sends a request to the same Product Catalog MCP endpoint, but this time includes a valid authorization token in the request headers. The request should succeed, returning a valid response from the backend service (e.g., product information). This demonstrates that the authorization policy is functioning correctly, allowing only authenticated users to access MCP-protected APIs.

    ![](./media/product-e3t2.png)

1. Next, scroll down to **Test the Place Order MCP Authorization WITH a valid token** and **Run** the cell to verify authenticated access to the order placement MCP endpoint. This step sends a valid, authorized request to the Place Order MCP API via API Management. The request includes a valid bearer token in the headers, ensuring that only authenticated users can perform order operations.
